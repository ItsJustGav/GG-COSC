  ## Set Up JavaFX in Eclipse:
  - Download JavaFX SDK from Gluon or openjfx.
  - In your files, extract the SDK to a directory of your choice.
  - In Eclispe navigate to **'Window' -> 'Preferences' -> 'Java' -> 'Build Path' -> 'User Libraries'.**
  - Click **'New...'** to create a new library and name it **'JavaFX'**.
  - Click **'Add External JARs...'** and navigate to the **'lib'** folder of the extracted JavaFX SDK, select all JAR files and add them.
  - Apply and Close.
